## <a name="Data">Data</a>

Once you have subscribed to our service, you will be received a username and a password that will let you input your external providers credentials to your data configuration in cegaware. Cegaware will then be able to request your providers for the market data needed to perform the action you asked.

If needed, we take in charge the entire development of the API specific to your providers that will allow Cegaware to communicate with any of your third-party data feed.

If you have not subscribed to our service, you can always leave your data configuration empty to access our demo market data base and still use our whole set of features for free.

## <a name="Model">Model</a>

Cegaware proposes a large selection of financial models to evaluate your contracts.

A close assistance can be provided based on expert considerations to help you to select the model that offers the best performance in terms of hedging costs, P&L explanation and computation efficiency regarding the contract you wish to analyse.

We are working consistently to improve the performance of our existing models in terms of speed and accuracy and are keeping aware of new methodologies able to better handle market effects.

In particular Cegaware can adapt your own models if any and integrate it into the solution for your needs.

## <a name="Pricer">Pricer</a>

Only three pricers to rule them all: Combined with variance reduction methods, barrier smoothing techniques and multihreading, our pricers produce accurate and reliable price and sensitivities:

A generic Monte Carlo engine that handles any complex contracts from vanillas to the most exotics.

For contracts with weak path dependency and low dimension, a pricer based on Finite Difference Method can be prefered to improve the accuracy.

Eventually, a Closed Form Method is proposed if the contract suits it well.
